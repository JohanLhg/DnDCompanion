# D&D Companion
While playing Dungeons & Dragons, it's never easy to keep all your character's info up to date. Having to update multiple stats every time you level up and calculating everything can be time consuming. And having 5 pages of different spells can make it difficult to manage during combat.

All these issues lead me to make this app (specifically for D&D 5th Edition). It will automatically update any information it can (for exemple when changing an ability score, it will update it's modifier, saving throw and related skills), help you organize your spell book and help you keep track of many other things.

D&D Companion also fetches information from different API's to get you weapon stats, classes, spells and more ! You can manage multiple characters on the same account and save them online.
